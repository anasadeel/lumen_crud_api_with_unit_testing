# lumen_crud_api_with_unit_testing
I recently developed an API with Laravel for a mini-project. I decided to build another API but with Lumen instead, since it’s a far lighter and faster framework than Laravel.  Lumen is a micro-framework built on top of Laravel’s core components. Lumen utilizes a lot of familiar concepts from Laravel such as Eloquent, caching, routing, middleware and it’s service container. One major advantage of Lumen is it’s speed, as a result the framework is designed for building fast micro-services or APIs.
